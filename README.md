# Library Competency Quiz

This small quiz is a competency pop-quiz for the Boot Camp. You will be building a front-end to back-end library application utilizing the technologies that have been taught so far in the Boot Camp. No answers/help will be provided on this quiz, please do not assist others on this quiz either!

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JS
- React, Fetch
- ExpressJS, NodeJS, Mongoose
- MongoDB

## Homepage (Form)

Your homepage will be a form. Inside of this form will be a space for a title, a space for a description and a space for a link to an image URL. When you submit this form, the new book will be stored inside of your database and then acquired on the other page of your assignment. 

## Library

Your next page (/library) will be a list of all of the books that were stored via your homepage. It will show the image URL, the title and the description of each book provided in some sort of format. If you have enough time at the end of the assignment, feel free to style this accordingly, otherwise a general organizational structure is fine.
